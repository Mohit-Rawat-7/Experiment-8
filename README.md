# Experiment-8
### AIM
To create a matrix by taking inputs from user and doing operations on it.

### Software Used
VS Code

### Problem Statement
1.) To make a matrix by taking number of rows and column from user.

2.) To make a matrix by taking number of rows and column from user and do their addition and multiplication.

3.) To add the diagonal elements of the matrix.

4.) To make the transpose of a matrix.

## Theory
Arrays are a way to store a list of items of the same type in a single structure. Imagine them as a row of boxes, where each box holds a value. These boxes are stored next to each other in memory, which allows us to quickly access any item by its position (or index). Arrays can be simple, with just one row (one-dimensional), or more complex, with multiple rows and columns (multidimensional).Matrices are a specific kind of two-dimensional array, like a grid or table, where numbers are arranged in rows and columns. 

### Matrix Addition
You can add two matrices if they have the same dimensions. To add them, you add the corresponding elements.

### Matrix Multiplication
To multiply two matrices, the number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix. Each element of the result is calculated as the sum of products of corresponding elements from the rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix.

### Diagonal Elements
In a square matrix (same number of rows and columns), the main diagonal runs from the top-left to bottom-right (e.g., 1, 5, 9 in the matrix above). The secondary diagonal runs from the top-right to bottom-left.

### Transpose of a Matrix
The transpose of a matrix is obtained by swapping rows with columns.
